= BSBL: Block Sparse Bayesian Learning

I developed fast implementations of the Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (*BSBL*, see [https://sites.google.com/site/researchbyzhang Zhilin Zhang's Website]) Framework, using the Fast Marginalized Likelihood Maximization method (see [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/events/aistats2003/proceedings/123.pdf Fast marginal likelihood maximisation for sparse Beysian models]).

== Basic

The BSBL-FM is a fast implementation of the BSBL framework. It is based on BCS ([http://www.ee.duke.edu/~shji/papers/BCS_preprint.pdf Ji2008]) and fastRVM ([http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-fastsbl.pdf Tipping2003]). The major contributions are the block extension and the exploiting of intra-block correlation. The BSBL-FM algorithm is extremely fast when the signal has *block structure* and low *block sparsity* level.
